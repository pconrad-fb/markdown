# Storage

The simplest place to store Markdown is on your own computer, of course. You can merrily save files to a folder deep in `My Documents` and go on your way, perhaps emailing someone a Pandoc-generated PDF from time to time. But if you want to enjoy the true power of collaborating and publishing with Markdown, you'll want to share the files you're working on or publish them in another form.

!!! hint
    Some Markdown tools, especially browser-based editors, sync directly with cloud
    storage and blogging sites.

### A shared server

If you are collaborating on documents or contributing to documentation at work, you might need access to a shared server such as SharePoint or Samba, WebDAV, or online tools such as a Google Drive account. You can store your source files there or upload HTML, Word, PDF, and other documents you create from your Markdown.

### Cloud storage

Cloud storage services like [Box](https://www.box.com), [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/), and [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com) are a great place to keep documents you want available from everywhere. You can save Markdown files from one computer and have them available on other devices, even sharing them with colleagues. Cloud storage is great for [Taking notes](../../recipes/recipes-notes), because it lets you add to your notes from anywhere.

## Web hosting

If you're creating online documentation or a website, you'll need a place to host it. Web hosting is far too big a subject to cover here, but you might need to investigate whether you need any of the following:

- A blog service such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/), or [Medium](https://medium.com/) where you can publish writing directly
- A web host, to present your HTML files as web pages
- FTP software to upload HTML to a web host
- Another integrated online publishing service or platform
