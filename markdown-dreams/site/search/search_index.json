It is an ecosystem of powerful tools that lets you do everything from quickly writing an HTML page, to managing a full doc set, to taking notes, to writing a novel---to creating a slide presentation. Markdown makes it easy to create content quickly, because its simple syntax covers most of the bases without requiring you to take your fingers off the keys.

Each recipe lists the tools you'll need. Markdown editor A Markdown editor is a specialized text editor that works with Markdown. Different editors have different features\u2014you'll want to play with more than one to find out which ones you like. Pandoc Pandoc enables your Markdown editor to import and export in several formats and also has a few tricks of its own. I recommend Pandoc for anyone who works with Markdown. Shared storage If you are collaborating with others, you might need a shared place to store Markdown files. You might also want web hosting or a blogging platform where you can publish your content when it's complete. Git Source control can be very important for collaborating without catastrophe. You'll need an account with a Git host, a Git client, and Git installed on your computer. Publishing tools Documentation management tools, static site generators, and even Pandoc can be useful to convert your content to a final format for general consumption. You can install everything up front, or just install what you need as you go along. If you're not sure, start with the following steps: Install Pandoc . Choose and install a Markdown editor . Set up Git . Hint Some editors detect pandoc, so installing it first is a good idea. Once you've got these tools installed, you can start trying the recipes. Things to know You'll find it easiest to follow the recipes in this guide if you are comfortable with the following topics: Markdown Syntax Although some editors provide a WYSIWYG experience, knowing how to write Markdown directly will help you work more quickly and easily with a wider variety of tools. See the Markdown cheatsheet Markdown comes in a bunch of flavors with different capabilities: CommonMark GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) Markdown Extra MultiMarkdown (MMD) Here are a few differences between these common flavors: CommonMark GFM Markdown Extra MMD Fenced Code Blocks \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 Syntax Highlighting \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 Tables \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 Footnotes \u2714 \u2714 Auto-linking \u2714 Strikethrough \u2714 Definition Lists \u2714 \u2714 Abbreviations \u2714 \u2714 Some tools include extensions that provide additional capabilities. Hugo , for example, has an extensible framework of shortcodes that let you create your own features. Many tools, including MkDocs , use the Python-Markdown Extensions , which offer additional formatting capabilities out of the box. There are also more complex systems that work with Markdown, such as Markdown+Math , which displays LaTeX math, and Mermaid , which generates diagrams. The command line Some of the recipes in this guide involve at least some typing on the command line. You'll definitely need to use the command line a little bit when you're working with Hugo , MkDocs , or Pandoc . Working with a package manager Installing some tools requires using one of the following common package managers: Linux: apt-get or yum macOS: Homebrew Windows: Chocolatey A package manager can make it easy to install several packages at once. For example: sudo apt-get install python3 ghostwriter pandoc mkdocs hugo gftp Git Some of the recipes in this guide use Git . Git is very powerful, but doesn't have to be hard to use. The recipes in this guide emphasize simplicity. If you already know Git, you can choose to do things differently. If you don't know git, take a look at Git basics . Other documentation tools The point of Markdown is to produce content that can be published and consumed in another format\u2014originally HTML, and now Word, slides, PDFs, and other formats.

If you use a graphical Git client and a WYSIWYG Markdown editor, the workflow is easy for people who like things simple. At the same time, Markdown in Git is powerful enough for engineers and integrates with their tools. The centralized Git workflow can be an effective way for content creators, managers, and engineers to collaborate on non-production content such as specifications, planning documents, newsletters, internal documentation, and the like. In this workflow, everyone works on the same branch. While this makes things easy for simple collaboration, it will cause headaches for larger teams, more complex content, or in a production environment. If you're publishing a large website or documentation set with a team of collaborators, you should consider using GitHub Flow instead. Ingredients Markdown editor Git Publishing tools (optional) Hint Plan ahead based on the publishing tool you want to use. If you're planning to use a wiki, MkDocs, or Hugo, organize your docs in Git wiki structure and add YAML frontmatter from the start. If you're creating large documents with Pandoc, think about whether you need to work on content in pieces and then use Pandoc to assemble everything. Working with content This recipe uses the centralized Git workflow. Pick an editor , then make sure you have Git set up and try each step below. The steps work together like a heartbeat that keeps content safe and synchronized for all collaborators. 1. Pull Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository to the local repository on your computer 2. Work Edit your content in your favorite Markdown editor 3. Stage and commit From time to time, in your Git client, type a short sentence about what you've done and save the changes to Git 4. Push When your work is final, push it up to the remote repository If you need to Publish content , you can use one of these recipes: Publish documentation with MkDocs Publish a website with Hugo Create a document with Pandoc Hint Remember not to publish content into a Git repository.

You can create a wiki to document projects or code stored in the repository, or you can just use a repository for its wiki capability. Note A Git wiki is a second repository attached to your repository. You clone, pull, and push to the main repository and the wiki separately. A Git wiki uses Git wiki structure and it's one way to develop content for publishing in MkDocs or Hugo . Hint If you use a Git wiki to develop content for Hugo, remember to add YAML frontmatter at the beginning of each file. Ingredients Markdown editor Git Set up a wiki on your hosted repository The easiest way to set up the wiki is by logging onto your Git host and adding it there. Bitbucket and Sourcetree In a browser, log on to Bitbucket. Under \"Repository settings\" look for \"Features\" and click Wiki Select Public wiki and save. GitHub and GitHub Desktop The GitHub documentation on Wikis is helpful. Here are the basic steps: In a browser, log on to GitHub. Click the Settings button: Scroll down to \"Features\" and select Wikis : Edit content on the host If you just want to add a few pages to the wiki online, there's no more setup to do! Just go to your repository, click Wiki , and you'll see buttons for creating and editing pages. Hint To add a page in a new folder, make the folder part of the new filename. For example: morestuff/newpage.md adds newpage.md in a folder called morestuff . Clone the wiki to a local repository There are advantages to working with wiki files locally, on your computer: It's much easier to add folders and move files around You can work on it even when you're offline You can use whatever Markdown editor you want Others can collaborate with you To work on the wiki locally, clone the wiki to a local repository: Bitbucket and Sourcetree Go to your online repository and click Wiki . Click Clone wiki then Clone in Sourcetree . Make sure the local path shows the directory where you want to clone the repository, and click Clone . GitHub and GitHub Desktop Go to your online repository and click the Wiki button: Copy the Clone this wiki locally URL. In GitHub Desktop, click File > Clone repository . Paste the URL, make sure the local path shows the directory where you want to clone the repository, and click Clone . Linux command line Go to your online repository and click Wiki . Copy the URL (or command and URL) to clone the wiki repository. On the command line, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Use git clone and the URL to clone the repository. Example: git clone https://my_name@bitbucket.org/my_name/markdown-stuff.git/wiki Work with the content locally On your computer, go to the directory where you cloned the wiki. There should be a directory called wiki containing a file called Home.md containing the Markdown source for the welcome page the wiki displayed when you created it online. You can now work with the wiki using the Git centralized workflow or the GitHub flow , using the familiar cycle of pull, edit, commit, push. Tutorial Here's a quick tutorial that shows how to organize pages in the wiki. Try creating some content Try making the following changes: Add a folder called stuff . Using your favorite Markdown editor, make a file called something.md inside stuff , with the following contents: # Something Yes, there's *something* here! Now go [home](../Home). You should now have a directory structure that looks like this: Home.md stuff/ something.md Take a look After you commit and push the changes, take a look in your online wiki: Go to your online repository and click Wiki .

What you need Markdown editor Git Publishing tools Hint Plan ahead based on the publishing tool you want to use. If you're planning to use a wiki, MkDocs, or Hugo, organize your docs in Git wiki structure and add YAML frontmatter from the start. If you're creating large documents with Pandoc, think about whether you need to work on content in pieces and then use Pandoc to assemble everything. Working with content Pick an editor , then make sure you have Git set up and try each step below. The steps work together like a heartbeat that keeps content safe and synchronized for all collaborators. 1. Pull Make sure you're on the master branch and sync the latest changes from the remote repository. 2. Create a branch Create (\"check out\") a branch for working on the current part of the content. 3. Work Edit your content in your favorite Markdown editor. 4.

There is way too much to document here, so the focus of this recipe will be getting started and a few basics. To install Hugo, use your operating system's package manager: Linux: apt-get or yum macOS: Homebrew Windows: Chocolatey You can also download and install the binary, or build it yourself from source. Ingredients Markdown editor Hugo Git (optional) Hint Hugo works best with Markdown files that are organized in Git wiki structure . You can even use Git wiki to develop the content, so long as you add YAML frontmatter as you go. This recipe goes well with: Centralized Git workflow GitHub flow Setting up your site Once Hugo is installed, you can create a new site by typing hugo new site my-project , which provides some instructions when it runs: $ hugo new site my-project Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in /home/pconrad/git/my-project. Just a few more steps and you're ready to go: 1. Download a theme into the same-named folder. Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or create your own with the \"hugo new theme <THEMENAME>\" command. 2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files with \"hugo new <SECTIONNAME>/<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>\". 3. Start the built-in live server via \"hugo server\". Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation. Adding a theme To add a theme, you use the git submodule add command from within your site directory. Each theme in Hugo's official Complete List includes instructions for adding the submodule from the correct Git repository. Example: $ git submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke Cloning into '/home/pconrad/git/my-project/themes/ananke'... remote: Enumerating objects: 8, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (8/8), done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done. remote: Total 1839 (delta 2), reused 1 (delta 0), pack-reused 1831 Receiving objects: 100% (1839/1839), 4.33 MiB | 1.26 MiB/s, done. Resolving deltas: 100% (1022/1022), done. After you've installed the theme, add it to the configuration file config.toml . Example: $ echo 'theme = \"ananke\"' >> config.toml Edit the config.toml file to change other things about the site, such as the site title or the base URL. Working with content You can create a new page with hugo new <path> . For example, to create a new post in the posts directory, type: hugo new posts/my-first-post.md When it's created, all this page contains is YAML frontmatter: --- title: \"My First Post\" date: 2020-08-28T18:42:02-07:00 draft: true --- You must add Markdown content before you can preview the page. A page in Hugo must contain both frontmatter and Markdown content. If either is missing, the page shows 404 page not found when you try to preview it. Frontmatter can signal content status inclusing publish and expiry dates, and can contain variables that you can use in templates and in content by creating your own Hugo shortcodes. Variables and shortcodes are outside the scope of this recipe, but the Hugo website has a lot of documentation. If you are migrating content into Hugo from a Git wiki, MkDocs site, or some other source, you will need to add frontmatter to any pages that don't already have it. Local preview To preview your content, start the Hugo server: $ hugo server -D The -D option tell Hugo to include draft pages in the preview. If you omit this option, any page with draft:true in the frontmatter is ignored. Hugo is a bit finicky about previewing and building content, and there are a few reasons why pages might not show up in the preview. Make sure each file contains both frontmatter and Markdown, that it doesn't have a publish date in the future or expiry date in the past, and so on. Images Images in Hugo normally go in the static directory. Here, I've added a subdirectory called images and when I add the image in my Markdown editor it looks like this: ![](../../static/images/whatever.png) That makes sense, since that is the correct relative path to the file. When the site is built for local preview, however, the result is this: <img src=\"../../static/images/whatever.png\" alt=\"\"> Unfortunately, that won't work. The actual relative path to the image is: ../../images/whatever.png instead. In other words, when you add an image whose relative path is correct with regard to the Markdown file, you must remove static/ from the path to make it work in the preview and the built site. If you are using an editor that lets you preview the images as you work, then you have to break all the images to get them to work in Hugo. One solution might be to upload all your images to the web first, then use absolute paths\u2014but this will make it more difficult to move the website or change the paths later. Building and publishing The hugo command builds the website in a directory called public . To publish the site, use FTP to transfer the contents of that directory to a folder on a webserver. Hint To prevent Git from tracking changes to the public directory, create a file called .gitignore at the top level directory of the Hugo project with the following contents: public/ If you use git add to add your .gitignore file to change tracking, then it will apply to anyone who clones the repo\u2014meaning that no one will add built HTML pages to Git.","title":"Publish a website with Hugo"},{"location":"recipes/recipes-hugo/#publish-a-website-with-hugo","text":"Hugo is a very powerful open-source static site generator that includes tools for organizing content, adding extensions, and even creating dynamic logic.

To install MkDocs, use your operating system's package manager: Linux: apt-get or yum macOS: Homebrew Windows: Chocolatey Because MkDocs is based on Python, you can also install it using the pip tool. Ingredients Markdown editor MkDocs Git (optional) This recipe goes well with: Centralized Git workflow GitHub flow Creating a project You can create a new doc set just by typing mkdocs new my-project and starting to add content. Of course, if you plan to use one of the Git workflows, you should run this command inside your local Git repository. The mkdocs new command sets up a directory that contains two things: A directory called docs containing index.md A file called mkdocs.yml that you use for configuring your project. As you might have guessed, index.md is a congratulatory default first page, and you can change it, add directories and files, and start building the site in the docs directory. Live preview The command mkdocs serve starts a webserver that lets you preview your content as you create it. Note You must run mkdocs serve in the directory that contains the mkdocs.yml file. Whenever you save a Markdown file, MkDocs does its best to update the preview. Sometimes if you change the site navigation, it can't keep up. When that happens, just use Control-C to stop the server and then type the command again to start it. When the webserver starts, it provides information about any broken links in your content, any files that are unused, and where to point your browser to see the content. Here's an abbreviated version of some output I got while working on these recipes: $ mkdocs serve INFO - Building documentation... INFO - Cleaning site directory INFO - The following pages exist in the docs directory, but are not included in the \"nav\" configuration: - getting-started/index.md - recipes/index.md WARNING - Documentation file 'recipes/recipes-centralized-workflow.md' contains a link to 'recipes-slides.md' which is not found in the documentation files.

Themes don't just change the look of the site\u2014they sometimes add extensions and capabilities (such as the Python Markdown Extensions ). You can add a theme, activate extensions, and set up site navigation in the site configuration file mkdocs.yml : To add a theme, you download a bunch of files (sometimes by cloning a Git repo) and copy them into your MkDocs project directory, then add the theme name to the theme parameter To use the theme's extensions, you list them in the markdown_extensions parameter To set up site navigation, list titles and filenames hierarchically in the nav parameter Here's an abbreviated version of my mkdocs.yml file: site_name: Markdown Dreams theme: name: material markdown_extensions: - admonition - pymdownx.highlight: use_pygments: true - pymdownx.snippets base_path: 'snippets/' nav: - 'How to do things with Markdown': 'index.md' - 'Getting started': 'getting-started/index.md' - 'Tools': - 'Markdown editors': 'tools/tools-editors.md' - 'Source control': 'tools/tools-git.md' - 'Publishing': 'tools/tools-publishing.md' - 'Recipes': - 'Overview': 'recipes/index.md' - 'Run a Git wiki': 'recipes/recipes-git-wiki.md' - 'Resources': 'resources/index.md' To save length, I stripped out a lot of the navigation, but you get the idea. Hint You don't have to set up navigation manually. If you don't, MkDocs provides fairly sensible navigation automatically. But the option is there if you need that level of control. Working with content For the most part, working with content is just as you would expect: Markdown in Git wiki structure, using the workflow of your choice. Here are a few tips: Links take some getting used to. Each link is relative based on the location of the page in which the link appears. Each file is treated as a folder by the browser. To link to the \"Source control\" page from \"Run a Git wiki\" in the above navigational structure, you would add the following link: [Source control](../../tools/tools-git.md) Because all HTML is valid Markdown, you can use HTML. However, you can't use Markdown inside a block of HTML. If you choose a theme that includes features like snippets and admonitions, then you can do things outside the bounds of normal Markdown. This is very useful, but makes it harder to use your Markdown source files with other tools (unless you take the fun stuff out). Hint If you have trouble with a link, look at the output of mkdocs serve . Snippets If you use snippets, the location of the included files is relative to the top-level directory of your project ( my-project for example). It's a good idea to create a directory for snippets and then define it in the base_path variable in your mkdocs.yml file. I created a directory called snippets and defined it as shown in the mkdocs.yaml sample above. That way, I can include snippets using only the filename and I don't have to think about a relative path from the page where I am using the snipppet: --8 < -- \"github-flow-snippet.html\" Hint Adding or changing a snippet sometimes requires restarting the webserver before the changes show up in the live preview. Building and publishing The mkdocs build command builds the website in a directory called site . Note You must run mkdocs build in the directory that contains the mkdocs.yml file. To publish the site, use FTP to transfer the contents of that directory to a folder on a webserver.

You can use any Markdown editor to work with files on your computer, but you can also share notes across your devices using a cloud storage service such as Dropbox plus a note-taking app like Joplin or a Markdown editor like Typora. This recipe describes two way to take notes: Using Joplin Using Typora Ingredients Markdown editor Cloud storage Joplin Joplin is designed specifically for taking notes, and shares some features with applications like Evernote. You can store your notes as local files on your computer, or sync them to the cloud with a service like Dropbox or OneDrive. You can even encrypt your notes end-to-end for privacy. Setting up Joplin is fairly straightforward. In the Preferences screen, there is a place to choose your storage: local filesystem, DropBox, and so on. If you want to sync Joplin across devices, configure all your Joplin instances to use the same cloud storage location. Getting your old notes from Evernote One of the great features of Joplin is that you can import notes from Evernote. The caveat is that the imported Markdown files will not have sensible filenames\u2014but this is still better than manually copying and pasting each note individually. To export each notebook from Evernote: Right click a notebook in the left nav and select Export notes Export the notebook as an ENEX file. In Joplin, go to File > Import and import the notebook as Markdown. You can then export the notebook as Markdown from Joplin into the folder where you have decided to store your notes. Typora An interesting alternative to Joplin is to use another editor such as Typora. Both Joplin and Typora provide a navigation tree to make it easy to organize and manage \"notes\" (which are just Markdown files). The advantage of Joplin is that it is a dedicated note-taking app. The advantage of Typora is that it is a Markdown editor, which means you get a lot more tools for integrating into a content management and publishing toolchain. If you plan to do more than note-taking, consider installing a Markdown editor such as Typora or Ghostwriter. Actually, there's nothing stopping you from using all three! Installing and using Typora is pretty straightforward. You can store files in multiple folders, which makes it easy to set up a note-taking folder, a drafts folder, a documents folder, and so on. Any of these folders could by synced by Dropbox or another service. Hint You can use Joplin to get your old notes from Evernote, then use Typora to manage and edit them. Setting up Typora to take notes To fine-tune Typora as a note-taking application, set a few preferences: Go to File > Preferences . Click the General tab: For On Launch, select Restore last closed folders . When you set up a folder to contain your notes, Typora will open it for you automatically. Of course, you can also open other files and folders. Check the Auto Save checkbox and make sure Save without asking\u2026 is checked. You won\u2019t have to think about saving notes; they\u2019ll just always be saved. Click the Image tab. Select Copy image to ./${filename}.assets . Typora will make a folder for each document\u2019s images. This makes it easy to take the images along if you convert the document to a different format or send it to another location. Check all the boxes except for the auto escape one. This makes sure that local files and online images also get added to the .assets folder. By the way, Typora saves copies of pasted images, too!

Ingredients Markdown editor Pandoc An ePub editor such as Sigil Creating the book The command for creating the book is simple. With a single Markdown file, it looks like this: pandoc -o my_book.epub my_markdown.md Concatenating multiple files You can specify as many files as you like. For example: pandoc -o my_book.epub chapter_1.md chapter_2.md Title file You can specify a title, author, licensing, and other information about the book in a file called title.txt at the front of the book, containing YAML that Pandoc uses when it benerates the ePub file. Example: --- title: How to do things with Markdown and Git author: Peter S. Conrad language: en-US ... Creating a book with a title file and multiple Markdown files looks like this: pandoc -o my_book.epub title.txt chapter_1.md chapter_2.md Images When your book includes images, use relative paths. For example: ![An image](../images/whatever.png) In the above example, the images directory is at the same level as the file containing the Markdown file; the relative path goes up a directory from the Markdown file and then down into the images directory to find the image. When Pandoc follows these relative links, it starts from the directory where you typed the pandoc command. If you want Pandoc to find your images, either run the command from a directory where the relative links to the images make sense, or copy the images to a place where the relative links can find them. Cleaning up If you are converting content from another project\u2014an MkDocs site, for example\u2014the Markdown files might include formatting such as Python extensions that Pandoc doesn't handle.

With a single Markdown file, it looks like this: pandoc -o my_document.docx my_markdown.md Special Pandoc formatting Pandoc includes a number of formatting tricks that you might find useful. One of the most useful is fenced div syntax, which uses groups of colon characters. You can use fenced div syntax to create columns using nested divs without writing <div> tags in HTML. Take a look at this example: :::::::::::::: {.columns} ::: {.column width=\"50%\"} Left column: - Bullet - Bullet - Bullet ::: ::: {.column width=\"50%\"} ![](bench.jpg) ::: :::::::::::::: That translates to a <div class=\"columns\"> containing two <div class=\"column\"> tags that Pandoc can understand. It uses these to create two columns in the Word doc. Each div can be signified with as few as three colons in a row; the outher div uses more colons here for readability. You can use curly braces to define attributes such as identifiers, classes, and key/value pairs on headers, images, and a few other elements in Pandoc. If you\u2019re using Pandoc to create long Word documents, this is handy because you can set anchors on headings and link to them internally. You can also use an attribute to scale an image: ![Alt text](bench.jpg){width=25%} When Pandoc renders the image, it is scaled to a percentage of the container where it resides (a column, for example). The alt text is used for a caption. Concatenating multiple files You can specify as many files as you like. For example: pandoc -o my_document.docx chapter_1.md chapter_2.md Title file You can specify a title, author, licensing, and other information about the book in a file called title.txt at the front of the book, containing YAML that Pandoc uses when it generates the file.

DZSlides creates bold, attractive slides that discourage the use of too much text. Ingredients Markdown editor Pandoc A browser Markdown for DZSlides Start your Markdown file with YAML metadata or a simple block like this: % Title % Author Name % Date DZSlides uses the horizontal rule ( --- ) as a separator between slides. A level one or level two heading is a section title. Here'\u0092s some sample Markdown: --- # H1 or H2 is a Section Title --- Normal Text or Slide Title - Bullet - Bullet --- Normal text is big enough for a title or announcement on a slide. The layout of slides in DZslides is bold and simple; you probably won'\u0092t find yourself using tables or columns a lot. Special Pandoc formatting Pandoc includes a number of formatting tricks that you might find useful. One of the most useful is fenced div syntax, which uses groups of colon characters as shorthand. The curly braces let you define attributes such as identifiers, classes, and key/value pairs on headers, images, and a few other elements in Pandoc. In the above example, the attributes specify the names and widths of the divs. Images When your Markdown includes images, use relative paths. For example: ![An image](../images/whatever.png) In the above example, the images directory is at the same level as the file containing the Markdown file; the relative path goes up a directory from the Markdown file and then down into the images directory to find the image. When Pandoc follows these relative links, it starts from the directory where you typed the pandoc command. If you want Pandoc to find your images, either run the command from a directory where the relative links to the images make sense, or copy the images to a place where the relative links can find them. After you create the presentation, which is an HTML file, you need to keep the images and the presentation together. If you copy your presentation to a thumb drive without the images, the images won't work. Hint It'\u0092s a good idea to create the Markdown presentation in a folder with all the images it needs, then use Pandoc to build the presentation in the same folder.

Ingredients Markdown editor Remark.js A browser Markdown for Remark Remark uses level one or level two headings for slide titles and separates slides with the horizontal rule ( --- ). Speaker notes are at the end of each slide, marked by three question marks ( ??? ). Here is some example Markdown: class: center, middle # Remark template .right[Author] .right[Date] --- # Slide title Normal text: * Bullet * Bullet * Bullet ??? Speaker notes go here --- Remark provides some rudimentary CSS to style slides. The above example uses class: center, middle to put the slide title in the middle of the slide, and .right to align the text showing the author and date. You can use normal Markdown image syntax, but you can also use CSS and HTML to change the way images appear: .center[<img src=\"bench.jpg\" width=50% height=50%></img>] More complicated CSS is available if you want to experiment further, but is beyond the scope of this recipe. Creating the presentation Remark needs three things to work: boilerplate HTML, the remark.js script, and your Markdown. Open boilerplate-remote.html in a text editor. Add your Markdown in the source text area. Example: <textarea id=\"source\"> class: center, middle # Title --- # Agenda 1. Introduction 2.

Here, it is just used to delineate the speaker notes. Not all Markdown formatting is appropriate for slides, but tables work nicely\u2014and Pandoc provides special formatting that lets you do a few interesting things. Special Pandoc formatting Pandoc includes a number of formatting tricks that you might find useful. One of the most useful is fenced div syntax, which uses groups of colon characters as shorthand. One of the most interesting uses of this syntax is to create columns using nested divs without writing <div> tags in HTML. Take a look at this example: :::::::::::::: {.columns} ::: {.column width=\"50%\"} Left column: - Bullet - Bullet - Bullet ::: ::: {.column width=\"50%\"} ![](bench.jpg) ::: :::::::::::::: That translates to a <div class=\"columns\"> tag containing two <div class=\"column\"> tags that Pandoc can understand. It uses these to create two columns in a PowerPoint slide. Each div can be signified with as few as three colons in a row; the outher div uses more colons here for readability. The curly braces let you define attributes such as identifiers, classes, and key/value pairs on headers, images, and a few other elements in Pandoc. In the above example, the attributes specify the names and widths of the divs. Images When your Markdown includes images, use relative paths. For example: ![An image](../images/whatever.png) In the above example, the images directory is at the same level as the file containing the Markdown file; the relative path goes up a directory from the Markdown file and then down into the images directory to find the image.

There are a few different types available: Dedicated Markdown editors usually let you write and edit Markdown code with syntax highlighting, and often have a preview pane or separate preview window. Code editors can be quite extensible and sophisticated, offering plugins and packages that provide many of the capabilities of a dedicated Markdown editor. Text editors are often more general-purpose than dedicated Markdown editors, and may or may not offer Markdown syntax highlighing or preview. Browser-based tools range from simple Markdown preview tools to full-featured writing and publishing tools that integrate with source control, blogging, or collaboration websites For blogging, you can use a browser-based tool \u2014in fact, some blogging sites support Markdown already. If you plan to create and manage documentation or other complex writing projects, it makes sense to install a dedicated Markdown editor . If you are adding Markdown to your code development environment, several code editors support Markdown very nicely. I have used Joplin and iA Writer, but I use Typora and Ghostwriter most often. Dedicated Markdown editors Most dedicated editors are designed so that you edit the Markdown directly, with syntax highlighting to make it easier to see that's going on. That's the original intention behind Markdown, after all: to provide formatting tools that are easy to read and don't require you to lift your fingers from the keys. For general purposes, many dedicated Markdown editors are fairly similar, differing in only a few features. Two tools in particular stand out: Joplin, a specialized editor for writing notes and to-do lists Typora, an elegant WYSIWYG editor for Markdown Byword Byword (macOS/iOS) provides syntax highlighting and an in-app preview, letting you exprt to a few formats or publish directly to Medium, WorkPress, Blogger, Tumblr, and Evernote. Caret Caret (macOS/Windows/Linux) offers interesting features such as a folders/files view, multiple cursors, keyboard-based selection tools, and smart help with tables and other formatting features. Ghostwriter Ghostwriter (Windows/Linux) is a free and open source split-screen editor that integrates with Pandoc and offers smaller \"heads-up display\" windows that provide document information and a Markdown cheat sheet. iA Writer iA Writer (macOS/iOS/Android/Windows) is intended for writers who want to focus. It integrates with Dropbox, provides the expected preview capabilities, and imports and exports to Microsoft Word. Joplin Joplin (macOS/iOS/Android/Windows/Linux) is an open-source note-taking and to-do application that syncs to DropBox, OneDrive, and other cloud storage. It includes an editor, but also supports the external editor of your choice. It offers end-to-end encryption and can import Evernote notebooks. MacDown MacDown (macOS) is an open source Markdown editor with a split screen and live preview, inspired by an early Markdown editor called Mou . Typora Typora (macOS, Windows, Linux) is a Markdown editor that includes not only a syntax editing mode but a fully WYSIWYG editing experience. It integrates with Pandoc, so it can import and export a number of formats. Typora offers a files and folders view, which means it can be used for longer documents or as a note-taking application. Code editors If you are documenting code in a large organization, you might need to write Markdown that meets fairly stringent standards to work with your documentation management and publishing system. Code editors, while they are not designed specifically for Markdown, sometimes offer sophisticated packages to support Markdown editing and preview. An advantage of a code editor is the ability to do things like jump to a specific line number or set text wrapping rules. The following editors, among others, are worth a look: Atom Sublime Text Visual Studio Code Text editors Because Markdown is just plain text, even the simplest text editor can be a capable tool. Some well-established text editors offer Markdown modes: BbEdit Emacs Vim Browser-based tools Browser-based Markdown tools can be an easy, portable way to write Markdown that you intend to publish to a blog. Some integrate directly with Git hosts, blogging sites, or cloud storage. Dillinger Dillinger is an open source online Markdown editor that integrates with DropBox, GitHub, Google Drive, and OneDrive. You can also import from BitBucket, or upload Markdown and HTML files from your computer. HackMD HackMD is an online Markdown editor, free for personal use, that integrates with GitHub and includes tools for creating slides . StackEdit StackEdit is a full-featured Markdown editor that syncs with DropBox, GitHub, GitLab, and Google Drive. You can import Markdown and HTML files, export with Pandoc, and publish to Blogger, Wordpress, and Zendesk. Markdown Dingus Markdown Dingus shows how John Gruber's official version of Markdown renders to HTML.

Hint You don't have to read through this page all the way through. Just refer to the parts you need. The recipes link to them. Branching workflows There are many possible branching workflows, but only two in this guide: Git Centralized Workflow : all work is done in a single branch GitHub Flow : different pieces of work are done in different branches Centralized Git workflow In the centralized Git workflow, everyone works on a single branch (usually called master ). Changes are committed to the local repository on each contributor's own computer. From time to time, each user pushes changes to a remote Git repository. Here are the operations a contributor performs when working in the centralized Git workflow. 1. Pull Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository to the local repository on your computer 2. Work Edit your content in your favorite Markdown editor 3. Stage and commit From time to time, in your Git client, type a short sentence about what you've done and save the changes to Git 4. Push When your work is final, push it up to the remote repository In the event that two people create conflicting changes, they can be manually resolved and then merged. Although this workflow is called \"centralized,\" it doesn't really resemble the old centralized source control model. The central remote repository is not a single source of truth, because every contributor has their own copy of the entire repository. The following recipes use the centralized Git workflow: Edit a Git wiki Collaborate using centralized Git workflow GitHub flow In the GitHub flow, you start a new branch based on master whenever you start a group of related tasks. How you organize those tasks, and how you decide which ones belong in a branch together, is up to you. Just like in the centralized workflow, you commit changes frequently to your own local repository. When you push to the remote repo, you create a copy of your branch there so that others can review your changes before they are merged back into master . Here's how your day looks in the GitHub flow. 1. Pull Make sure you're on the master branch and sync the latest changes from the remote repository. 2. Create a branch Create (\"check out\") a branch for working on the current part of the content. 3. Work Edit your content in your favorite Markdown editor. 4. Stage and commit From time to time, in your Git client, type a short sentence about what you've done and save the changes to Git. 5. Push From time to time, sync your branch up to the remote repository. 6. Create a pull request When your work is ready for review, create a pull request and add reviewers. If there's more work to do before final approval, you can edit your content, stage and commit, an push to the existing pull request. 7. Merge When your work is approved, merge your branch into master on the remote repository Merge conflicts in your working branches are less likely, because own your branches and other people don't necessarily work in them with you. Conflicts are more likely to happen between your working branch and the master branch on the remote repo. Before you push your branch to the remote repo, you can pull from master again and merge any conflicts locally. Hint After you've pushed, approved, and merged your work, you can delete your working branch or keep it around for further work. When you start work on a different part of the project, remember to switch to master and pull again before creating a new branch. The following recipe uses the GitHub flow: Managing docs with GitHub flow How to Git These are the commands that make up the steps in the Git branching workflows. Pull The Git pull command fetches and downloads content from your remote repository, automatically merges the changes with your local repository, and updates everything so that your repository matches the latest version of everything on the remote. It's a good idea to pull after making sure you're on the right branch and before starting to work on the content. Sourcetree Make sure you're on the right branch in the correct repository: The bold text under Branches tells you the branch The tab at the top of the screen tells you the repository Select Repository > Pull or click the Pull button. GitHub Desktop In GitHub Desktop, you can fetch and pull separately. Fetch gets the latest updates from origin but doesn't update your local working copy with the changes. After you click Fetch origin , the button changes to Pull Origin . Make sure you're on the right branch in the correct repository: The bold text under Current branch tells you the branch The bold text under Current repository tells you the repository Select Repository > Pull or: Click the Fetch origin button. Click the Pull origin button. Linux command line Make sure you're on the right branch in the correct repository: $ git branch * master $ git remote -v origin https://github.com/pconrad-fb/markdown.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/pconrad-fb/markdown.git (push) Type the git pull command: $ git pull Stage and commit Git knows when you make changes to your files. When you want to save those changes to Git, you must do two things: stage them, which tells Git which changes you intend to keep commit them, which saves the changes. Sourcetree In Sourcetree, you stage and commit your files in two operations. Make sure you're on the right branch in the correct repository. Look for the files you changed in the Unstaged files pane. Select the files you want to stage\u2014in most cases, you can just click Stage All. Make sure you see the right files in the Staged files pane. Type a short commit message and click Commit . GitHub Desktop In GitHub Desktop, you can stage and commit your files in one step. Make sure you're on the right branch in the correct repository. Look for the files you changed in the Changes tab. Unselect any files you don't want to change\u2014most of the time, you can leave all the checkboxes checked. Type a short commit message. Make sure the Commit button refers to the correct branch (\"Commit to master,\" for example). Click Commit to [branch] . Linux command line Make sure you're on the right branch in the correct repository. Use git status to see what changes are not yet staged. Stage any changes you plan to commit. In many cases, you can stage all the changes at once like this: $ git add * Commit the changes, adding a descriptive message: $ git commit -m \"Type your descriptive message here.\" Hint If you are changing files but not adding or deleting any files, you can often stage and commit all in one line with commit -am like so: $ git commit -am \"Type your descriptive message here.\" Push Sourcetree Make sure you're on the right branch in the correct repository. Select Repository > Push or click the Push button. GitHub Desktop Make sure you're on the right branch in the correct repository. Select Repository > Push or click the Push origin button. Linux command line Make sure you're on the right branch in the correct repository. Push, specifying the remote (usually origin ) and the branch. For the recipes where you are working on the master branch, the command looks like this: $ git push origin master Of course, since git knows what branch you're on and where your remote is, you can sometimes just type git push . Create a branch Sourcetree Pull from master. Click the Branch button: Type a descriptive name and click Create Branch . Look under Branches to see that you're on the new branch. You can switch to a different branch by clicking it in the list of branches. GitHub Desktop Pull from master. Click the Current branch tab and click New branch : Type a descriptive name and click Create branch : Click Publish branch : Look under Branches to see that you're on the new branch. You can switch to a different branch by clicking it in the list of branches. Linux command line Pull from master to make sure you have the latest changes: $ git checkout master Already on 'master' Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'. $ git pull Already up to date. Create a new branch and switch to it with git checkout -b . Example: $ git checkout -b test-branch Switched to a new branch 'test-branch' You can switch to any existing branch by typing git checkout <branch-name> without the -b . Example: $ git checkout -b test-branch Switched to branch 'test-branch' Hint You can't switch branches with uncommitted changes. You have to commit before switching to a new branch. Create a pull request Bitbucket and Sourcetree Click Repository > Create pull request . In the dialog that appears, click Create Pull Request On Web : Type a description, add reviewers, and click Create pull request : GitHub and GitHub Desktop When you push, the banner with the Push button changes \"Create a pull request from your current branch.\" Click Create Pull Request : The browser opens a page with a form for creating a pull request: Click the gear next to Reviewers to add reviewers: Click Create pull request .

Follow the instructions on screen. If you get stuck, you can see some hints in the instructions for Bitbucket or GitHub. Approve and merge Merge your branch online in the web interface of your Git host. Bitbucket When your pull request is sufficiently approved, click Merge : GitHub When your pull request is sufficiently approved, click Merge : Getting out of trouble If you get out into the woods with Git, there's usually a way to get back\u2014but for this kind of magic, you have to go to the command line. Working in the wrong branch So you've edited a file in the wrong branch. What you'd like to be able to do is undo those changes, switch branches, then re-do them. Actually, it would be even better to lift those changes off of the wrong branch, laying them gently on top of the branch you meant to be in. Fortunately, Git provides a command called stash that does exactly that. Make sure you're in the right directory. Use git status to check what branch you're on and what changes Git knows about. Make sure you're in the branch where you were erroneously working. For example: $ git checkout -b the-wrong-branch Switched to branch 'the-wrong-branch' Stash your uncommitted changes: $ git stash Switch to the branch you wish you had been working in: $ git checkout -b the-wrong-branch Switched to branch 'the-wrong-branch' Use stash to apply the changes there: $ git stash apply Editing the wrong file You opened a file to look at it, but then your cat walked across the keyboard. You're not sure what was added or deleted. You just want to go back to the way things were at the last commit. For this, use checkout . Make sure you're in the right directory. Use git status to check what branch you're on and what changes Git knows about. If necessary, switch to the correct branch. For example: $ git checkout -b the-branch Switched to branch 'the-branch' Use git status to see what files were accidentally modified. For example: $ git status On branch master Changes not staged for commit: (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed) (use \"git checkout -- <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory) modified: dont-change-this.md Use git checkout to undo the changes. For example: git checkout -- dont-change-this.md Hint The output of the git status command tells you how to use git checkout this way. Staged too soon You edited the right file the right way, but then you added it to the staging area too hastily. You don't want to undo your changes to the file, but you would like to remove it from the next commit. This is one of the uses of reset . You can also use reset to do more drastic rollbacks\u2014you can undo entire commits if you want. Make sure you're in the right directory. Use git status to check what branch you're on and what changes Git knows about. If necessary, switch to the correct branch. For example: $ git checkout -b the-branch Switched to branch 'the-branch' Use git status to see what files were accidentally modified. For example: $ git status On branch master Changes to be committed: (use \"git reset HEAD <file>...\" to unstage) renamed: README.md -> README modified: dont-commit-this.md Use git reset to remove the file from the next commit. For example: git reset HEAD dont-commit-this.md Hint The output of the git status command tells you how to use reset to unstage changes. Merge conflicts When Git is unable to automatically merge, it means that two changes happened in the same place in the same file. That means you need to edit the file and decide which of the two changes to keep. When you open the file, the merge conflict looks like this: <<<<<<< HEAD Some content that was changed by one person ======= Other content that someone else changed >>>>>>> 9af9d3b HEAD is a pointer to the most recent commit in the branch you're on. The other label can be another branch name or a number representing another commit. All you need to do is decide which version of the content you want to keep and then delete the merge conflict markers ( <<<<<<< , ======= , >>>>>>> ). After you've resolved all the changes in that way, just commit again.

Changes are committed to the local repository on each contributor's own computer. From time to time, each user pushes changes to a remote Git repository. Here are the operations a contributor performs when working in the centralized Git workflow. 1. Pull Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository to the local repository on your computer 2. Work Edit your content in your favorite Markdown editor 3. Stage and commit From time to time, in your Git client, type a short sentence about what you've done and save the changes to Git 4. Push When your work is final, push it up to the remote repository In the event that two people create conflicting changes, they can be manually resolved and then merged. Although this workflow is called \"centralized,\" it doesn't really resemble the old centralized source control model. The central remote repository is not a single source of truth, because every contributor has their own copy of the entire repository. The following recipes use the centralized Git workflow: Edit a Git wiki Collaborate using centralized Git workflow","title":"Centralized Git workflow"},{"location":"tools/tools-git-basics/#github-flow","text":"In the GitHub flow, you start a new branch based on master whenever you start a group of related tasks. How you organize those tasks, and how you decide which ones belong in a branch together, is up to you. Just like in the centralized workflow, you commit changes frequently to your own local repository. When you push to the remote repo, you create a copy of your branch there so that others can review your changes before they are merged back into master . Here's how your day looks in the GitHub flow. 1. Pull Make sure you're on the master branch and sync the latest changes from the remote repository. 2. Create a branch Create (\"check out\") a branch for working on the current part of the content. 3. Work Edit your content in your favorite Markdown editor. 4. Stage and commit From time to time, in your Git client, type a short sentence about what you've done and save the changes to Git. 5. Push From time to time, sync your branch up to the remote repository. 6. Create a pull request When your work is ready for review, create a pull request and add reviewers. If there's more work to do before final approval, you can edit your content, stage and commit, an push to the existing pull request. 7. Merge When your work is approved, merge your branch into master on the remote repository Merge conflicts in your working branches are less likely, because own your branches and other people don't necessarily work in them with you. Conflicts are more likely to happen between your working branch and the master branch on the remote repo. Before you push your branch to the remote repo, you can pull from master again and merge any conflicts locally. Hint After you've pushed, approved, and merged your work, you can delete your working branch or keep it around for further work.

But if you're collaborating with others, read on! With Git, you synchronize files on your computer with files on a remote repository\u2014usually an online Git host.

Git concepts There's a lot to know about Git. As a writer, you should be able to decide how much you want to learn. You might just want to learn exactly enough to do your writing and keep out of trouble. That's the goal here. If you want to learn more, check out The Git Book . There are a lot of Git terms that are confusing. A lot of things that used to be intuitive\u2014like the idea that we're working on files and we need to lock them so that someone else can't check them out from the central repository \u2014 have no currency in the Git world: There's no central repository. A central repository would represent both a bottleneck and a single point of failure, so why do it? No one checks out files because there's no central repository. We don't need to lock files because we don't have to worry about them being checked out . In fact, we don't care about files at all in Git. We only care about changes. What things mean in Git Let's say you have a directory of files you're working on. yes, Git doesn't care about files, but you do! Commit You open a file in an editor, make some changes, and save the file. Git will notice the changes you made to the file. If you meant to make those changes, you must commit them. This is like \"saving changes to Git.\" A commit is a group of changes. When you commit, you type a little note describing the changes so that people know what was done. Stage Before you commit changes, you tell Git explicitly which changes to track. This is called staging. Since changes go with files, sometimes people think of it as staging the files themselves\u2014but it's really the changes that Git wants to know about. If you delete a file, that's a change too. Repository When you have committed, your changes are stored in the repository, or repo for short. It's just like that old central repository, but it's on your computer. Push If you want other people to be able to work on your files, then you need to put them in an online repository (such as Bitbucket, GitHub, or GitLab). This is not checking in since the changes are already committed to your local repository. This is called a push to a remote repository . Clone Once something is in an online repository, an authorized person can clone their own copy of the whole repository. Pull As you work on a repository you've cloned, you can pull the latest changes to stay up to date. Branch Git lets people work in separate work streams called branches so that they don't interfere with each other's work. A branch is just a series of commits (and a commit is a group of changes). You're always working in a branch, even if it's the only branch. When you have several branches to work in, Git remembers the state of everything in each branch so that when you switch between them everything is just how you expect it. Creating a new branch is called branching, of course. The Git command for creating (or switching to) a branch is called, confusingly, checkout. There are different branching strategies. Some are complicated; others are simple. The recipes in this guide use two branching strategies, described in Git basics . Merge If there's more than one branch, there always comes a time to merge, which means to add the changes from one branch into another. Why branching is cool Git keeps track of the whole history of all the changes on all the branches. Not only does that mean you can roll back to any point in time, it also means that when you switch branches all your files magically change to match whatever changes you've made in that branch. For example, I created a branch called test-branch based on the master branch. Working in test-branch , I added a file called new-file.md which you can see in the directory: $ ls getting-started img index.md new-file.md When I switch to master , it's not there: $ git checkout master Switched to branch 'master' Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'. $ ls getting-started img index.md When I switch back to test-branch , it's there: $ git checkout test-branch Switched to branch 'test-branch' $ ls getting-started img index.md new-file.md Branching is cool.

Branch Git lets people work in separate work streams called branches so that they don't interfere with each other's work. A branch is just a series of commits (and a commit is a group of changes). You're always working in a branch, even if it's the only branch. When you have several branches to work in, Git remembers the state of everything in each branch so that when you switch between them everything is just how you expect it. Creating a new branch is called branching, of course. The Git command for creating (or switching to) a branch is called, confusingly, checkout. There are different branching strategies. Some are complicated; others are simple. The recipes in this guide use two branching strategies, described in Git basics . Merge If there's more than one branch, there always comes a time to merge, which means to add the changes from one branch into another.","title":"What things mean in Git"},{"location":"tools/tools-git/#why-branching-is-cool","text":"Git keeps track of the whole history of all the changes on all the branches. Not only does that mean you can roll back to any point in time, it also means that when you switch branches all your files magically change to match whatever changes you've made in that branch. For example, I created a branch called test-branch based on the master branch. Working in test-branch , I added a file called new-file.md which you can see in the directory: $ ls getting-started img index.md new-file.md When I switch to master , it's not there: $ git checkout master Switched to branch 'master' Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'. $ ls getting-started img index.md When I switch back to test-branch , it's there: $ git checkout test-branch Switched to branch 'test-branch' $ ls getting-started img index.md new-file.md Branching is cool.","title":"Why branching is cool"},{"location":"tools/tools-git/#next-steps","text":"Set up Git","title":"Next steps"},{"location":"tools/tools-publishing/","text":"Publishing tools There are many tools for publishing Markdown or converting it for use in other doc tools. We'll focus on the Git wiki, the static site generators Hugo and MkDocs, and Pandoc. We'll also touch on tools for creating presentations. Git wiki A Git wiki is a special additional repository attached to your Git code repository. You create and clone a git wiki separately from your main repository. Git wiki structure A Git wiki uses folders to organize files. The path to a file is used to create the URL where the content is displayed. A simple directory structure might look like this: Home.md stuff/ something.md In that case, the URL to the content in something.md is: /wiki/stuff/something See also: Edit a Git wiki Hugo Hugo is an open-source static site generator that includes templates and provides exensibility in the form of shortcodes, which provide additional formatting. You can even create your own shortcodes. See also: Publish a website with Hugo MkDocs MkDocs is a static site generator that turns directories of Markdown files into a searchable, presentable website. Customizable themes, many of them provided by the community, provide Markdown extensions for reusing content and for formatting such as tabs and admonitions. See also: Publish documentation with MkDocs Pandoc Pandoc is a tool that can convert between Markdown and a number of formats. You can use Pandoc to create Word and Powerpoint documents, PDFs, HTML, and several kinds of presentations. For longer documents, can concatenate Markdown files together. Pandoc includes formatting tricks that let you do things like create columns or scale images, and you can use stylesheets from existing documents to give your content a specific look and feel. You can also convert from various formats to Markdown, including doing things like grabbing a web page as a Markdown file. You can even try it online . See also: Create a Word document Create an ePub Create a PDF Grab a web page Create a Powerpoint presentation Create a DZSlides presentation FTP When you create a website with Hugo or MkDocs, you'll use file transfer protocol (FTP) to upload the files to the web. You can do this from the command line, but it's much easier to choose an application that gives a nice UI and lets you save bookmarks. Here are a few: FileZilla - a free, open source FTP tool for macOS and Windows gFTP - the default Linux option Transmit - a commercial file transfer app for macOS Presentation tools Here are two tools that you can use for in-browser presentations. DZSlides DZSlides is a single page, HTML-based slide presentation template. Pandoc can generate a DZSlides presentation from a Markdown file. See also: Create a DZSlides presentation Remark Remark is an in-browser presentation tool made from Javascript, HTML, CSS, and, of course, Markdown. The slideshow lives in a <textarea> tag where you can add and edit Markdown directly. See also: Create a Remark presentation Other tools If you are converting Markdown to a format such as Word, PDF, or ePub, it can be useful to have editing tools to help you fix any problems in the final result: Acrobat - the original PDF reader LibreOffice - an open-source office suite Microsoft Office - an office suite that includes Word and PowerPoint Sigil - a multi-platform ePub editor","title":"Publishing"},{"location":"tools/tools-publishing/#publishing-tools","text":"There are many tools for publishing Markdown or converting it for use in other doc tools.

You can merrily save files to a folder deep in My Documents and go on your way, perhaps emailing someone a Pandoc-generated PDF from time to time. But if you want to enjoy the true power of collaborating and publishing with Markdown, you'll want to share the files you're working on or publish them in another form. Hint Some Markdown tools, especially browser-based editors, sync directly with cloud storage and blogging sites. A shared server If you are collaborating on documents or contributing to documentation at work, you might need access to a shared server such as SharePoint or Samba, WebDAV, or online tools such as a Google Drive account. You can store your source files there or upload HTML, Word, PDF, and other documents you create from your Markdown. Cloud storage Cloud storage services like Box , DropBox , and OneDrive are a great place to keep documents you want available from everywhere. You can save Markdown files from one computer and have them available on other devices, even sharing them with colleagues. Cloud storage is great for Taking notes , because it lets you add to your notes from anywhere. Web hosting If you're creating online documentation or a website, you'll need a place to host it. Web hosting is far too big a subject to cover here, but you might need to investigate whether you need any of the following: A blog service such as Wordpress , Blogger , or Medium where you can publish writing directly A web host, to present your HTML files as web pages FTP software to upload HTML to a web host Another integrated online publishing service or platform","title":"Storage"},{"location":"tools/tools-storage/#storage","text":"The simplest place to store Markdown is on your own computer, of course.
