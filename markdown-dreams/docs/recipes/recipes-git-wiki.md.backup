# Working with a Git wiki

A Git repository comes with a wiki, which makes it possible to collaboratively read and edit documentation. You can create a wiki to document projects or code stored in the repository, or you can just use a repository for its wiki capability.

!!! note
    Different Git hosts deal with wikis in different ways. At the time of writing, 
    adding a wiki to a repository on GitHub required either that the repository be 
    public or a paid version. If you are having trouble adding a wiki to a repository,
    make sure your repo is public.
    
A Git wiki bases the URLs for pages on the file hierarchy. Consider a wiki with the following files:

```
Home.md
stuff/
    something.md

```

The URL to `something.md` is: /wiki/stuff/something
    
## Before you begin

Make sure you have read [Git basics](../../getting-started/getting-started-git-basics).

You'll need:

- Git installed on your computer
- An account with an online Git host
- A repository set up on your host such as Bitbucket
- A Git client such as Sourcetree
- A text editor or Markdown editor

!!! note
    This recipe doesn't use branching at all. This might seem strange to anyone
    who has been using Git for a while.
    
## Set up a wiki on your repository

The steps are similar for different Git hosts and clients. Here is what those steps look like in Bitbucket and Sourcetree:

1. In a browser, log on to Bitbucket (or your preferred host).
1. Under "Repository settings" look for "Features" and click **Wiki**
1. Select **Public wiki** and save.

If you just want to add a few pages to the wiki online, there's no more setup to do! Just go to your repository, click **Wiki**, and you'll see buttons for creating and editing pages. 

!!! hint
    To add a page in a new folder, make the folder part of the new filename. 
    For example: `morestuff/newpage.md` adds `newpage.md` in a folder called 
    `morestuff`.

## Cloning the wiki to your local repository

There are advantages to cloning the wiki to your local repository:

- It's much easier to add folders and move files around
- You can work on it even when you're offlne
- You can use whatever Markdown editor you want

Although the wiki is associated with a repository, it's actuall a separate repository of its own. You need to clone it separately. Here are the steps for Bitbucket:

1. Go to your online repository and click **Wiki**.
2. Click **Clone wiki** then **Clone in Sourcetree**.

!!! note
    If you can't find **Clone in Sourcetree** (or, for GitHub, **Open in GitHub
    Desktop**) in your online repository:
    
    1. In your online repository, go to the wiki and look for the URL to
       clone the wiki repository locally.  
    1. In your client (Sourcetree or GitHub Desktop), click **File > Clone** 
       and paste the URL, then click **Clone**.

## Working with the wiki locally

On your computer, to to the directory where you cloned the wiki. There should be a directory called `wiki` containing a file called `Home.md`&mdash;the Markdown source for the welcome page the wiki displayed when you created it online.

You can now work with the wiki with the following simple steps:

1. [**Pull**](../../getting-started/getting-started-git-basics/#pull).
2. Make some changes.
3. [**Commit**](../../getting-started/getting-started-git-basics/#stage-and-commit).
4. [**Push**](../../getting-started/getting-started-git-basics/#push).

#### Try creating some content

Try making the following changes:

- Add a folder called `stuff`.
- Using your favorite Markdown editor, make a file called `something.md` inside `stuff`, with the following contents:  

    ```
    
    # Something

    Yes, there's *something* here! Now go [home](../Home).

    ```
    
You should now have a directory structure that looks like this:

```
Home.md
stuff/
    something.md

```


#### Take a look

After you commit and push the changes, take a look in your online wiki.

1. Go to your online repository and click **Wiki**.
2. View the page tree of the wiki. For example:
	- In Bitbucket, click the name of the wiki.
	- In GitHub, click **Pages**.
1. Navigate to the page you created.

1. Try the `home` link.
