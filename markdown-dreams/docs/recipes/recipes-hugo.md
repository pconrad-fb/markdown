!!! hint
    Hugo works best with Markdown files that are organized in  
    [Git wiki structure](../../tools/tools-publishing#git-wiki-structure).
    You can even use [Git wiki](../recipes-git-wiki/) to develop the content.

This recipe goes well with:

- Working by yourself on your local hard drive
- [Centralized Git workflow](../recipes-centralized-workflow/)
- [GitHub flow](../recipes-gitflow/)

Make sure yoiu have the ingredients for those as well

## Setting up your site

- Configuration and preferences

## Working with content

- Extra markdown stuff like short codes or extensions

## Publishing

- generating the site
- FTP it somewhere?
