## Git wiki


It's kind

!!! note
    Different Git hosts deal with wikis in different ways. At the time of writing, 
    adding a wiki to a repository on GitHub required either that the repository be 
    public or a paid version. If you are having trouble adding a wiki to a repository,
    make sure your repo is public.

### Git wiki structure

By default, GitHub wikis are flat, with no hierarchy. Inside a repository, you can create folders and place individual wiki pages in them. These pages are simply separate files, where the filename becomes the page name.

# MkDocs

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a static site generator that turns directories of Markdown files into a searchable, presentable website. Customizable themes, many of them provided by the community, provide Markdown extensions for reusing content and for formatting such as tabs and admonitions.

        Very cool, extensible, easy, live preview

A Git wiki bases the URLs for pages on the file hierarchy. Consider a wiki with the following files:

```
Home.md
stuff/
    something.md

```

The URL to `something.md` is: /wiki/stuff/something


You can also  publish [Slides](../tools-slides/)

### Slides in Pandoc
Making Slides with Pandoc: the Basics

Pandoc is an everything-to-everything converter, and one of its neatest tricks is turning Markdown into slides. If you can do simple things on the command line, you will have no trouble: Pandoc is easy to install and use.

When using Pandoc, you can start your Markdown file with YAML metadata or a simple block like this:

% Title
% Author Name
% Date

Then write some Markdown for your slides. Pandoc uses the following rule to figure out what header level to use for slide titles:

    By default, the slide level is the highest header level in the hierarchy that is followed immediately by content, and not another header, somewhere in the document. In the example above, level 1 headers are always followed by level 2 headers, which are followed by content, so 2 is the slide level. (source)

That seems a little complicated, so I played with the Markdown a bit to see what worked in different presentation formats. In general, an H1 or H2 header works for a section header or slide title. Most other Markdown works as you would expect. Some presentation tools work best if you separate slides with three hyphens (---).

Building a presentation with Pandoc is simple:

pandoc -t <format> -s myslides.md -o myslides.htm

Pandoc can build slides from several formats. I tried a few including S5, Slidy, and slideous. IÂ’ll focus on two in particular: DZslides and Powerpoint.

Remark
DZslides

If you want to do one of those slick presentations with big images and very few words, [DZslides](http://paulrouget.com/dzslides/) is an easy way to do it.
