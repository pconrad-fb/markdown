## Storing your markdown

The simplest place to store Markdown is on your own computer, of course. You can merrily save files to a folder deep in `My Documents` and go on your way, perhaps emailing someone a Pandoc-generated PDF from time to time. But if you want to enjoy the true power of collaborating and publishing with Markdown, you'll want to put your files online.

Shared folder on a server? Samba? sharepoint?

### Cloud storage
Cloud storage services like [Box](https://www.box.com), [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/), and [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com) are a great place to start. You can save Markdown files from one computer and have them available everywhere, even sharing them. Cloud storage is great for [Taking notes](../../recipes/recipes-notes), because it lets you add to your notes from anywhere.

## Publishing to the web

If you're creating online documentation or a website, you'll need a place to host it. You might need web hosting if you're using the following recipes to publish online:

- [Distributed workflow](../../recipes/recipes-distributed-workflow/)
- [Gitflow](../../recipes/recipes-gitflow/)
- [Slides](../../recipes/recipes-slides/)
