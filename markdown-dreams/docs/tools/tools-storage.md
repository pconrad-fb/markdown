# Storage

The simplest place to store Markdown is on your own computer, of course. You can merrily save files to a folder deep in `My Documents` and go on your way, perhaps emailing someone a Pandoc-generated PDF from time to time. But if you want to enjoy the true power of collaborating and publishing with Markdown, you'll want to put your files online.

## The cloud

Cloud storage services like [Box](https://www.box.com), [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/), and [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com) are a great place to start. You can save Markdown files from one computer and have them available everywhere, even sharing them. Cloud storage is great for [Taking notes](../../recipes/recipes-notes), because it lets you add to your notes from anywhere.



## Web hosting

If you're creating online documentation or a website, you'll need a place to host it. You might need web hosting if you're using the following recipes to publish online:

- [Distributed workflow](../../recipes/recipes-distributed-workflow/)
- [Gitflow](../../recipes/recipes-gitflow/)
- [Slides](../../recipes/recipes-slides/)
