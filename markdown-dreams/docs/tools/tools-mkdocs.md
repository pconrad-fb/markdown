# MkDocs

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a static site generator that turns directories of Markdown files into a searchable, presentable website. Customizable themes, many of them provided by the community, provide Markdown extensions for reusing content and for formatting such as tabs and admonitions.
