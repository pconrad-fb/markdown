# How to do things with Markdown

Markdown is not just a markup language. It is an ecosystem of powerful tools that lets you quickly craft an HTML page, manage a full doc set, take notes, write a novel&mdash;even create a slide presentation. Markdown makes it easy to create content quickly, because its simple syntax covers most of the bases without requiring you to take your fingers off the keys.

With shared storage or source control, Markdown can be a powerful collaboration framework, suitable for both technical and non-technical contributors and supported by tools that meet every preference.

This guide presents some basic recipes for working with some useful Markdown tools. Each recipe lists what you'll need. Read [Getting started](getting-started/getting-started/) to learn how to get set up.

If you want to know more about the available tools first, you can browse these sections:

- [Markdown editors](../tools/tools-editors/)
- [Publishing tools](../tools/tools-publishing/) 
- [Source control with Git](../tools/tools-git/).

Consider installing more than one Markdown editor to see which features you like.

## About the recipes

Each recipe explains the goals, "ingredients," and procedures for an interesting way to use Markdown. Just as a lasagna recipe doesn't contain instructions for preheating (or installing) the oven, the recipes in this guide don't contain software installation instructions. Git commands are not repeated from recipe to recipe, but documented more centrally to keep the recipes short.

The idea is to help you get started and work around some of the less obvious "gotchas"&mdash;not to provide complete documentation. You might find it helpful to open each tool's website as you try the recipes, in case you get stuck.

Some recipes go together. You might use [Centralized Git workflow](../recipes/recipes-centralized-workflow/) to manage content you are editing in a [Git wiki](../recipes/recipes-git-wiki/) with the goal of [publishing a website with Hugo](../recipes/recipes-hugo/). Or you might take content that you started by [taking notes](../recipes/recipes-notes/) and turn it into a [slide presentation](../recipes/recipes-slides-remark/).
