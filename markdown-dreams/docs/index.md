# How to Do Things with Markdown

<!--
TO DO

Talk about how you edit, store, publish
How these docs work - what's a recipe? 
Why aren't all the instructions on one page? Because once you know how to click the pull button you don't need to see that again
Decide on sentence vs. title case and implement throughout


How to do things with Markdown
Getting started - Edit pass
Tools

    Markdown editors - Edit pass
    Storage - Edit, add content. What are the goals and gotchas? Lots of MD editors sync
    with something, especially the online ones
    Git 

        About Git - you need a host/git/client, here's what they're for. You can branch
        or not - plus edit for clarity
        Git setup - foreshadow the steps and why we're doing it. Add tabs with steps for
        GitHub and GHD
        Git basics - Foreshadow more. What are workflows? How do we use the commands in
        the recipes? Plus edit pass. Add commands to get out of trouble for BB/GHD/shell
    Publishing - Add content for Git wiki. Play with Hugo. Write MkDocs content and 
    Pandoc content and Preso tools content.

Recipes

    Take notes - write content
    Edit a Git wiki - add steps for GHD/shell, major edit, add overviews
    Collaborate using Git centralized workflow - edit pass
    Manage docs with GitHub Flow - edit pass, focus on publishing and make consistent
    with centralized worklow
    Publish a website with Hugo - Play with Hugo, write content, talk about publishing
    Publish documentation with MkDocs - write content, talk about publishing, make
    consistent with Hugo
    Create a document with Pandoc - write content
    Grab a web page with Pandoc - write content
    Create a standalone presentation - write content

Resources - go through and find places to link, terms, etc. and grab links fom my other page

- What are we doing? - from full doc set to Git wiki, to just notes or a novel
	+ You're here, so you're using MD not other markup
	+ You want to write content easily
	+ You might want to collaborate or store safely
	+ You might want to publish somewhere

The recipes tell you what components they need.
I assume you know how to install an editor or other tool.
We'll talk about Git because there are specific easy ways to use it.

You need to think about:
- Creating and editing content
- Where to store it
  - Local hard drive
  - DropBox or other backend
- Whether to use source control
- Where to publish it

## About the recipes

Just as a lasagna recipe assumes you know how to boil water, the recipes in this guide assume you know some stuff. Each recipe has to be short. So for example there isn't a copy of the Git workflow and how to Push in every recipe that uses Git. Fortunately, they link to the instructions. In other words, common instructions are in one place but linked to.

The recipes go together. You might use Centralized workflow to manage content you write in Markdown along with MCreate a document in Pandoc to publish to a PDF, or you might take content that started out in Notes and turn it into a standalone slide presentation. The goal is for you to understand the pieces and combine them however yo uwant.
