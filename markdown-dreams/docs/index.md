# How to Do Things with Markdown

<!--
TO DO

Talk about how you edit, store, publish
How these docs work - what's a recipe? Why aren't all the instructions on one page?
-->

The recipes tell you what components they need.
I assume you know how to install an editor or other tool.
We'll talk about Git because there are specific easy ways to use it.

You need to think about:
- Creating and editing content
- Where to store it
  - Local hard drive
  - DropBox or other backend
- Whether to use source control
- Where to publish it




- Not going to fully re-document things like:
	+ Installation
	+ Basic setup
	+ Syntaxes and languages like Python, Markdown, etc
- What I will do is give guidance to things that aren't obfious

- What are we doing? - from full doc set to Git wiki, to just notes or a novel
	+ You're here, so you're using MD not other markup
	+ You want to write content easily
	+ You might want to collaborate or store safely
	+ You might want to publish somewhere
- Tools - a brief description of the tools
	+ Markdown editors - comparison
		* Typora
		* Ghostwriter
		* iA Writer
		* Online
	+ Git - do I have to use Git?
		* What's Git for?
		* Git clients compared, command line
		* Almost no reason not to use it
		* If you are scared of Git, use DropBox, OneDrive, etc.
		* Git doesn't have to be hard
			- Concept of source control
				+ I save, you save, you overwrite me
				+ I lock file, you can't overwrite me
					* Centralized workflow
				+ Would be nice to be able to both work on the file
					* One branch
					* Multiple branches
	+ Publishing
		* Git wiki
		* MkDocs
			- They have themes with different kind of extensions
			- Very cool, extensible, easy, live preview
		* Hugo
		* Pandoc
			- eBook
			- PDF
			- Word
- Setup
	+ Might as well start with Pandoc.
	+ Pick an editor. They're easy to set up.
		* Some use Pandoc
	+ How about some Git
		* Whatever you're doing, getting set up is easy
			* Start online, grab link from button
			* Start on command line, decide later
			* Do not use Git and Dropbox. Use either/or
