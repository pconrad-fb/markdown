# How to do things with Markdown

Markdown is not just a markup language. It is an ecosystem of powerful tools that lets you do everything from quickly writing an HTML page, to managing a full doc set, to taking notes, to writing a novel&mdash;to creating a slide presentation. Markdown makes it easy to create content quickly, because its simple syntax covers most of the bases without requiring you to take your fingers off the keys.

With shared storage or source control, Markdown can be a powerful collaboration tool, suitable for both technical and non-technical contributors and available in editors to meet every preference.

This guide presents some basic instructions to get set up with some useful Markdown tools, and some recipes for using them. Each recipe lists what you'll need. You might want to get a basic set of tools set up first. Read [Getting started](../getting-started/getting-started/) to learn more.

If you want to know more about what tools are available first, you can browse these sections:

- [Markdown editors](../tools/tools-editors/)
- [Publishing tools](../tools/tools-publishing/) 
- [Source control with Git](../tools/tools-git/).

You might find it interesting to install more than one Markdown editor to see which features you like.

## About the recipes

Each recipe explains the goals, "ingredients," and procedures for an interesting way to use Markdown. Just as a lasagna recipe doesn't contain instructions for preheating (or installing) the oven, the recipes in this guide don't contain software installation instructions. Git commands are not repeated from recipe to recipe, but documented more centrally to keep the recipes short.

Some recipes go together. You might use [Centralized Git workflow](../recipes/recipes-centralized-workflow/) to manage content you are editing in a [Git wiki](../recipes/recipes-git-wiki/) with the goal of [publishing a website with Hugo](../recipes/recipes-hugo/). Or you might take content that you started by just [taking notes](../recipes/recipes-notes/) and turn it into a [slide presentation](../recipes/recipes-slides-remark/).
