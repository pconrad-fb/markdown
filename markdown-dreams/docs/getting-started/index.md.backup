# Getting started

You can start working with Markdown just by opening your favorite text editor and starting to type, but you probably want to do more than that. You might want to 
share information on a website or wiki, take notes, or publish an eBook. You'll find it easiest to follow the recipes in this guide if you are comfortable with the following topics:

**Markdown Syntax**  
Although some tools provide a WYSIWYG experience, knowing how to write [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) directly will help you work more quickly and easily with a wider variety of tools. 

**The command line**  
Most of the recipes in this guide involve at least some typing on the command line, if only to install tools. 

**Working with a package manager**  
Installing the tools requires using one of the following common package managers:

  - Windows: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
  - macOS: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  - Linux: [apt-get](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto) or [yum](http://yum.baseurl.org/)

**Git**  
Some of the recipes in this guide use [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
