# Storage

The simplest place to store Markdown is on your own computer, of course. You can merrily save files to a folder deep in `My Documents` and go on your way, perhaps emailing someone a Pandoc-generated PDF from time to time. But if you want to enjoy the true power of collaborating and publishing with Markdown, you'll want to put your files online.

## The cloud

Cloud storage services like [Box](https://www.box.com), [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/), and [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com) are a great place to start. You can save Markdown files from one computer and have them available everywhere, even sharing them. Cloud storage is great for [Taking notes](../../recipes/recipes-notes), because it lets you add to your notes from anywhere.

## Source control

Any time you collaborate with others, source control is important. Although you could just share a folder in the cloud, eventually there will come a time when someone overwrites or deletes something important. That's where source control comes in. And by "source control," I mean Git. 

### Why Git?

Back in the day, there were all kinds of source control systems. The ones I remember were all pretty easy to use, but were all centralized&mdash;meaning that only one person can edit any given file at any given time. Worse, it means that there's one central source of truth; if that gets corrupted or lost, everything is gone. Git solves these problems and [doesn't have to be hard to use](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/git-doesnt-have-to-be-hard-e1e115be6668).

There are many places to host a Git repository. You might start with one of these:

- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)

You can use Git on the command line, but it's even easier if you use a Git client like one of these:

- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

With Git, you can collaborate safely with others, working independently and merging your work as needed. That's why Git is so useful for recipes like these:

- [Distributed workflow](../../recipes/recipes-distributed-workflow/)
- [Git wiki](../../recipes/recipes-git-wiki)
- [Gitflow](../../recipes/recipes-gitflow)

!!! note
    For the examples in this guide, I've decided to use Bitbucket and Sourcetree. Other
    Git repositories and clients are similar, so you should be fine if you select
    something else. One thing I like about Sourcetree is the way it handles staging
    (committing) files.

## Web hosting

If you're creating online documentation or a website, you'll need a place to host it. You might need web hosting if you're using the following recipes to publish online:

- [Distributed workflow](../../recipes/recipes-distributed-workflow/)
- [Gitflow](../../recipes/recipes-gitflow/)
- [Slides](../../recipes/recipes-slides/)
