# MkDocs

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a static site generator that turns directories of Markdown files into a searchable, presentable website. Customizable themes, many of them provided by the community, provide Markdown extensions for reusing content and for formatting such as tabs and admonitions.

## Getting set up

You can usually install MkDocs with a standard *package manager:*

- Command line necessary 
- Use apt-get, dnf, homebrew, yum, chocolatey, etc
- Installing is not as hard as it sounds
