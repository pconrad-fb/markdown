# MkDocs

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a static site generator that turns directories of Markdown files into a searchable, presentable website. Customizable themes, many of them provided by the community, provide Markdown extensions for reusing content and for formatting such as tabs and admonitions. 

MkDocs runs on Python, so you'll be working on the command line when you install it, create a new documentation set, or build your documentation. When you get MkDocs running, it sits there in the background and serves a local preview of your site that updates as you edit your documentation.

## Getting set up

You can use your favorite package manager to install MkDocs:

- Chocolatey: `choco install mkdocs`
- Homebrew: `brew install mkdocs`
- Apt: `sudo apt-get install mkdocs`

You can check that the installation was successful by typing `mkdocs --version` on the command line. 

See the [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) site for more information.

An alternative way to install MkDocs is to use use the Python package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).
